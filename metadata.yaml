description: According to some accounts, Mary Queen of Scots bore a child to her last
  husband, the earl of Bothwell, while imprisoned at Loch Leven. In Unknown to History,
  C.M. Yonge weaves the story of this child, linking it with that of her mother. The
  Author tells us that In Miss Strickland's Life of Mary Queen of Scots (and in Burton's
  History of Scotland) a report may be found on which this tale is based. This is
  a fascinating and enthralling story of royalty, plot and intrigue, and was originally
  pu.
